        "\n",
        "The IWT DSR is a comprehensive tool for managing water treatment workflows. Below are its key capabilities, tailored to support field chemists, facility managers, and analysts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Structured Data Collection\n",
        "- **Purpose**: The DSR provides a standardized template for entering water quality metrics (e.g., conductivity, pH, alkalinity) across systems like potable water, boilers, and cooling towers.\n",
        "- **Sheets Involved**:\n",
        " - **Data Input**: Core sheet for entering raw data (e.g., meter readings, chemical levels).\n",
        " - Example: Metrics for 'Test Sink Cold Dist' include conductivity, pH, chloride, and chlorine levels.\n",
        "- **Benefit**: Ensures consistent data capture, reducing errors in field reports due to sloppy writting or not catching data entered in the wrong place.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Reference and Validation\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Defines acceptable ranges for metrics to validate system performance.\n",
        "- **Sheets Involved**:\n",
        " - **Reference**: Lists min/max values for metrics (e.g., Free Chlorine: 0.5–4 ppm for Cold Dist).\n",
        " - **Control Charts**: Tracks metrics against control limits for quality assurance.\n",
        "- **Benefit**: Enables quick identification of deviations (e.g., high chloride in condensing boilers).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Reporting\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Generates formatted reports for stakeholders, facility staff, or engineers.\n",
        "- **Sheets Involved**:\n",
        " - **Report**: Full site visitation report with system data and comments.\n",
        " - **Short Report**: Condensed summary with key metrics and ranges.\n",
        "- **Benefit**: Simplifies communication with facility staff (e.g., comments and data on same page).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Chemical Management\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Tracks on-site chemicals and their dosages.\n",
        "- **Sheets Involved**:\n",
        " - **Chem On Site**: Lists chemicals by system (e.g., Sodium Sulfite for boilers).\n",
        " - **Chem List**: Comprehensive catalog with item numbers, prices, and dosages.\n",
        "- **Benefit**: Supports inventory management and cost estimation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Actionable Recommendations\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Provides system-specific actions based on metric deviations.\n",
        "- **Sheet Involved**:\n",
        " - **Recommendations**: Suggests actions (e.g., 'Increase surface blowdown' for high conductivity).\n",

        "\n",
        "The DSR’s modular design makes it highly adaptable and scalable:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Independent Sheets**: Each sheet serves a distinct function (data input, reference, reporting, etc.), allowing users to update or use only relevant modules.\n",
        "- **System Flexibility**: Supports multiple system types (e.g., Boiler, Cooling Tower, Potable) with customizable metrics.\n",
        "- **Extensibility**: New systems or chemicals can be added to sheets like 'Data Input' or 'Chem List' without restructuring the template.\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Suitable for single facilities or multi-site operations, with potential for database integration.\n",
        "- **Automation Potential**: The structured format is ideal for automation (e.g., parsing into SQLite, generating dashboards)."
